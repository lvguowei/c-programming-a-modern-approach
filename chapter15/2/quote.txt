hello        this is my first
time having       this class with you                        
Assemblerisaalskdjflaskdjflksdjflaksdjflaksdjf (assembly) language is a low-level
programming language, and it is specific to a particular
processor (microcontroller) architecture [2]. As the oldest
programming language, and of all languages, it bears the
closest resemblance to a native machine language. It
provides a direct access to computer hardware, requiring
you to understand much about your computerâ€™s architecture
and operating system [3].
A large number of modern microcontrollers are based on
a similar architecture as the microcontroller 8086 [3] and
have similar abbreviations for the names of assembly
instructions. So, the study of microcontroller 8086 is
reckoned not only for pedagogica
